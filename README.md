TODO Application
=====

Yet another todo or tasks related web application?

Yes, but this but this comes with RESTful communication, ease of use, cool Java EE 7 features and client agnosticism (an Android or iOS client would be a simple exercise - and will follow some day!).

Tested with Glassfish 4 and Wildfly 8.
An example deployment (without persistence) can be found on www.sebastian-daschner.de/todos-example/

The idea of the task contexts is from the todo.txt command line app from ginatrapani.
